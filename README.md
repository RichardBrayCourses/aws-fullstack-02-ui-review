# UI - Typescript, Vite, React Router, Tailwind, ShadCN

In this section we will build an initial skeleton UI application in small steps and run it locally using a Vite dev server.

The application will be purely standalone and not connect to any AWS services.

The application will not at this stage contain any Oauth or Cognito functionality - that will be added in the next section.

This section is intended for newcomers to React development who would like to see the UI put together from first principles.

If you are an experienced React Developer then you might prefer to just build and run the source code in this repo to get a brief overview.

# To build and run the code

- clone the repo to your desktop and run these commands from the project root

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
